# Baby Keyboard
## Description
This is a simple keyboard game for babies. Baby wants to bang/type on the keyboard but baby seems to find every unknown shortcut and easter egg every built into the operating system. I then have to put computer back together again.

This is a work in progress. It works but does not have all of the functionality I would like.
